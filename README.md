# Introduction
In this lesson, I learned about the significance of immersive environments for users to experience immersive moments. Therefore, I also hope to use as much as possible in the project to create an immersive game with a multi-sensory experience.

> We designed a multi-player immersive music somatosensory game. We use the sensory impact of hearing and vision to create the emotions and stories that can be directly generated by each experience. And we use electronic vinyl records to record all the abstract emotions and stories during the touch process. It also creates their own music and memories for users.
