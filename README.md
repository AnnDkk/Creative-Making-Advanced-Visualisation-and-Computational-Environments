# Introduction
In this lesson, I learned about the significance of immersive environments for users to experience immersive moments. Therefore, I also hope to use as much as possible in the project to create an immersive game with a multi-sensory experience. 
</div>  

> We designed a multi-player immersive music somatosensory game. We use the sensory impact of hearing and vision to create the emotions and stories that can be directly generated by each experience. And we use electronic vinyl records to record all the abstract emotions and stories during the touch process. It also creates their own music and memories for users.

# Concepts
Touch is a universal language that conveys warmth and love to people. Many times people can't see the abstract emotion that this behavior brings. When I was imitating the gesture of using fingertips to say hello with my classmates, I suddenly had the inspiration of expressing touch.

</div>

We are extending from how to express the power of touch, hoping to give people an immersive experience of the touch process from a multi-sensory perspective. Ultimately, we chose to use music and visual effects to enhance emotional expression. At the same time, we add more meaning to the form of interaction. We want to record the process of users touching each other through a record. It embodies abstract emotions and stories, and enhances the experience of the game through people's natural physical contact.

# Working Process & Coding
> In the process of the overall production, we first carried out the division of labor production. Liao and me(Dong) were first responsible for building the overall model space and the movement and linking of the game environment in unity. Wang was first responsible for studying the circuit of the Arduino part. One week later, we conducted an integration study to deal with the problems of each part and the beautification of details, and connected the overall game.

## Modelling
We carried out the initial model building in Blender. And decided to abstract the recording process into a tunnel space, as if the user in the three-dimensional space of the record touch interactive experience.

## Coding（Arduino & Unity）
> We want unity to automatically turn the record player when it detects that a game has started. But since we're using a motor that can't change its speed, we slow the motor down by stopping every few seconds. The code is as follows: 

</div> 

<div align=center>

</div>

> For the interaction part, we first consider changing the circuit voltage through the human capacitance to send a signal to the unity recognition to sense the human touch and trigger the special effect.

<div align=center>

<img src="https://github.com/AnnDkk/Creative-Making-Advanced-Visualisation-and-Computational-Environments/blob/main/Image/WechatIMG675.png" width="400" height="300">
</div>

</div>

</div>
However, after a preliminary attempt, it was found that the scheme could not change the capacitance difference to make the Arduino signal through the human body touch each other. Only a single human contact circuit can signal.

</div>

## Challenges
We searched the tutorial and found that it is possible to increase the resistor value to 1M ohms to more accurately identify the voltage plug generated when conducting electricity through the human body. 
</div>
<div align=center>

</div>

However, after testing, we found that we still need a more conductive medium to accurately detect the effect of voltage changes when people touch each other.
So finally we re-use the Makey Makey board to do this part of the interaction.

## Making
> In order to make it more convenient for users to use the interactive port, I packaged it with tin foil and made the handle. It increases the contact area without affecting its conductivity. In addition to the main control port, each of these ports triggers a visual effect and an audio effect when linked through the human body.

> In order to give users a better hearing experience, we also created drinks. Special sound effects and background music were designed for each touch.

> Finally, we used the packaging carton to copy the record burner and placed the Arduino and other circuits in it.

# Achievement
After finishing the production, we invited many students in the school to participate in the game process. I found that this kind of game through the natural interaction link of the human body not only expressed the power of touch, but also enhanced people's emotions and made them more immersed in the experience of touch in the process.

> And most of the participants also said that it was very interesting to generate so many visual and auditory experiences through the simplest touch interaction between people! They also enjoy the process of recording their emotions.
