# Introduction
In this lesson, I learned about the significance of immersive environments for users to experience immersive moments. Therefore, I also hope to use as much as possible in the project to create an immersive game with a multi-sensory experience. 
</div>  

> We designed a multi-player immersive music somatosensory game. We use the sensory impact of hearing and vision to create the emotions and stories that can be directly generated by each experience. And we use electronic vinyl records to record all the abstract emotions and stories during the touch process. It also creates their own music and memories for users.

# Concepts
Touch is a universal language that conveys warmth and love to people. Many times people can't see the abstract emotion that this behavior brings. When I was imitating the gesture of using fingertips to say hello with my classmates, I suddenly had the inspiration of expressing touch.

We are extending from how to express the power of touch, hoping to give people an immersive experience of the touch process from a multi-sensory perspective. Ultimately, we chose to use music and visual effects to enhance emotional expression. At the same time, we add more meaning to the form of interaction. We want to record the process of users touching each other through a record. It embodies abstract emotions and stories, and enhances the experience of the game through people's natural physical contact.

# Working Process & Coding
> In the process of the overall production, we first carried out the division of labor production. Liao and me(Dong) were first responsible for building the overall model space and the movement and linking of the game environment in unity. Wang was first responsible for studying the circuit of the Arduino part. One week later, we conducted an integration study to deal with the problems of each part and the beautification of details, and connected the overall game.

## Modelling
We carried out the initial model building in Blender. And decided to abstract the recording process into a tunnel space, as if the user in the three-dimensional space of the record touch interactive experience.

> Complete the entire game space in unity and re-create tiles and shaders for better presentation.

## Coding（Arduino & Unity）
> We want unity to automatically turn the record player when it detects that a game has started. But since we're using a motor that can't change its speed, we slow the motor down by stopping every few seconds. The code is as follows:

> For the interaction part, we first consider changing the circuit voltage through the human capacitance to send a signal to the unity recognition to sense the human touch and trigger the special effect.

However, after a preliminary attempt, it was found that the scheme could not change the capacitance difference to make the Arduino signal through the human body touch each other. Only a single human contact circuit can signal.
